- **Custom Fonts:** Utilizes a custom font for the logo (`Odin Font`) and a modern sans-serif for the body text.
- **Form Validation:**
    - Uses HTML5 `required` attributes for built-in browser validation.
    - Custom JavaScript handles the comparison of the two password fields.
    - Provides visual feedback (red borders) for invalid inputs.
- **CSS Styling:** Features a dual-pane design, custom box shadows, and hover effects for a polished look.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** For the form's structure and semantic markup.
- **CSS3:** For all styling, layout, and visual effects (Flexbox, Grid, custom fonts).
- **JavaScript ES6:** For custom form validation logic.
